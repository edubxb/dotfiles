# edubxb's dotfiles

This repo contains the configuration files (aka 
[dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/)) of the tools I use.

My workflow relay mainly in these three tools:

- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

You'll find configuration files for other tools too.

[Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org/) is my OS, because I :heart: it, but
probably my setup will work in other distros too.

Feel free to use, copy, modify, or do whatever you want with these files, but
please, use them with care because there's no warranty :sweat_smile:.
